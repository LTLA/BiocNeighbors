Description: Implements a k-nearest neighbor search based on 
    pre-clustering with the k-means algorithm, as described by
    Wang (2012). This is faster than conventional kd-trees for
    neighbor searching in higher (> 20) dimensional data. 
    Functions are also provided to search for all neighbors 
    within a given distance. Parallelization is achieved using
    the BiocParallel framework.
