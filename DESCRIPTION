Description: Implements exact and approximate methods for nearest neighbor 
    detection, in a framework that allows them to be easily switched within 
    Bioconductor packages or workflows. The exact algorithm is implemented 
    using pre-clustering with the k-means algorithm, as described by Wang 
    (2012). This is faster than conventional kd-trees for neighbor searching 
    in higher (> 20) dimensional data. The approximate method uses the Annoy 
    algorithm. Functions are also provided to search for all neighbors within
    a given distance. Parallelization is achieved for all methods using 
    the BiocParallel framework.
